***Current Infrastructure:***

The clients had a web- and mobile application for its customers. This application relies on a REST API, with the web portion being served from dedicated static content servers. Additionally, the application utilises a central customer database and a corporate mail server for its functionalities. Access logs are sent to a distinct storage system, and employees also rely on a separate application (such as a CRM or ERP system) that shares the same database.

NOTE:  All elements of this setup were hosted within a single data centre on bare metal hosts. Load balancers and servers each have two replicas, with the database consisting of a primary and a read replica.


***Technologies Involved:***

The migration involved a variety of technologies, including

- Web and Mobile Application:
  - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Backend: REST API, implemented in a server-side language (e.g., Python, Ruby, Node.js)
- Static Content Servers: 
  - Dedicated servers for serving static content
- Central Customer Database:
  - Database Management System (DBMS) for customer data 
- Corporate Mail Server:
  - Mail server software 
- Access Logs Storage System:
  - Distinct storage system for access logs
- CRM or ERP System:
  - Separate application for CRM or ERP, sharing the central customer database
- Data Center Infrastructure:
  - Bare metal hosts for hosting all elements
  - Load balancers for traffic distribution
  - Two replicas for each server and database for redundancy

each requiring careful consideration and integration into the new infrastructure.

*Integration Points:*

Identifying and managing integration points between applications and systems was a critical aspect of the migration. A comprehensive strategy ensured a seamless transition without compromising data integrity.
